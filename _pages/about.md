Hey! Thanks for stopping by. If you are looking for information about my academic research, go to [my other page](https://darenmeiri.wordpress.com/)

## The Name

Sometimes you need to write notes down somewhere. This site is a virtual stack of notes. There's no consistency in the frequency of my posts. And the topic can vary. But hopefully my notes will help you out in some way. If I can save you a few minutes (or hours) of your time because of something I wrote then woo hoo!

## Setup

* This site is using the theme [Minimal Mistakes](https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/).
* Built using [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com), and hosted for free on [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com)
* I could have easily done with this WordPress, but that would have been too simple!
