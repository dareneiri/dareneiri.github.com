Hey! Thanks for stopping by. If you are looking for information about my academic research, go to [my other page](https://darenmeiri.wordpress.com/)


I am currently a data scientist for an electronic health record software company. Previously I worked in IT support/administration at UC San Diego and Wolfram Research. My formal education is in biology (BS and MS in Biology) and was able to publish two peer-reviewed papers on honey bee health. I started a PhD program at the University of Texas, Austin, but left because it no longer aligned with my [long-term personal goals](https://darenmeiri.wordpress.com/2014/10/30/why-i-decided-to-leave-academia/).


This website serves as a resource for myself, and hopefully others, who are trying to find documentation online to do X or Y and accomplish Z. 

## The Name

I titled this website "A Stack of Notes" since this will serve as a repository of notes during times of troubleshooting or when I am learning something new.

## Setup

* This site is using the theme [Minimal Mistakes](https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/).
* Built using [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com), and hosted for free on [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com)
* I could have easily done with this WordPress, but that would have been too simple!
