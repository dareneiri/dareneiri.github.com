Hey! Thanks for stopping by. If you are looking for information about my academic research, go to [my other page](https://darenmeiri.wordpress.com/)


I am a data scientist for an electronic health record software company. I really enjoye working with data and the challenges that come with it. 


This website serves as a resource for myself, and hopefully others, who are trying to find documentation online to do X or Y and accomplish Z. 

## The Name

I titled this website "A Stack of Notes" since this will serve as a repository of notes during times of troubleshooting or when I am learning something new.

## Setup

* This site is using the theme [Minimal Mistakes](https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/).
* Built using [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com), and hosted for free on [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com)
* I could have easily done with this WordPress, but that would have been too simple!
