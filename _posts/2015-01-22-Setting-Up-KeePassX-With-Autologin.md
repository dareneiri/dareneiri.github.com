_This post is intended for Mac users setting up KeePassX and getting autologin + browser (specifically, Chrome) support to work. At the time of this writing, the official build does not support autologin. However, there are other versions of KeePassX that are available to use, you just need to compile them._

## Requirements
- To make things simple, I recommend [installing XCode](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/downloads/). If you wish to install only the specific tools needed, you should install make, cmake, and clang
- Download the [KeePassX source from GitHub](https://github.com/jdachtera/keepassx). There is a "Download Zip" button on the right side of the page.
- Install [ChromeIPass browser extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/chromeipass/ompiailgknfdndiefoaoiligalphfdae?hl=en)
- Download [Brew](http://brew.sh), or type the following in Terminal:
	<pre>ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)"</pre>
	and then install:
    <pre>brew tap homebrew/dupes</pre>


## Compiling the Build
1. Once you download the source, make sure you know where it saved (i.e., your Downloads folder). Unzip it.
2. Then you need to open Terminal (Applications > Utilities > Terminal.app) and navigate to that folder. In Terminal, type:
	<pre>cd Downloads/keepassx-master</pre>
3. Then run:
	<pre>brew install qt cmake libgcrypt zlib libmicrohttpd</pre>
    <pre>cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=$HOME/local/apps/keepassxhttp -DCMAKE_VERBOSE_MAKEFILE=ON</pre>
    <pre>make</pre>
    <pre>make install</pre>
4. Congrats! You compiled an app from source! You will find the Application installed in your Applications folder. If not, look at the last line in Terminal and see where the install path is:
    <pre>-- Installing: /Applications/KeePassX.app/</pre>

## Setting up the ChromeIPass Browser Extension
1. Once you open the KeePassX application, ChromeIPass may need to establish a connection to the application.
	You will get notified by the extension to have KeePassHTTP connected. All you need to do is launch KeePassX, and click on the extension icon to establish the connection.

**Keep in mind** that you will need to have KeePassX remained open so that ChomeIPass can recognize that Keepasshttp is running.
